      <h2 class="timeline">Here's a time line of Dr. Alan Turing's life:</h2>
      <ul class="height">
        <li><span class="bold">1912:</span>  Alan Turing is born on June 23 in Maida Vale, London, England. </li>
        <li><span class="bold">1931:</span>  He studies mathematics at King's College, Cambridge.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1936:</span>  Turing writes a famous paper about the "Turing Machine," a key idea in computer science.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1938:</span>  Receives his Ph.D. from Princeton University, where he works on mathematical logic and cryptanalysis.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1939:</span>  During World War II, Turing starts working at Bletchley Park, the UKâ€™s codebreaking center.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1940:</span>  He helps to break the German Enigma code, which helps the Allies in the war.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1942:</span>  Turing designs the Bombe, an electromechanical device used to decipher Enigma-encrypted messages,  leading to numerous Allied victories.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1945:</span>  Awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his wartime services.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1945:</span>  Until 1948, Turing worked on designing a computer at the National Physical Laboratory.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1948:</span>  He becomes a professor at the University of Manchester and continues his work on computers.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1950:</span>  Turing writes a famous paper about artificial intelligence and the "Turing Test."</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1954:</span>  Alan Turing dies on June 7 at the age of 41, but he is remembered as one of the greatest thinkers in computer science.</li>
      </ul>
